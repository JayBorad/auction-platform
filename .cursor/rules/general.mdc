- This project is a real-time cricket auction web app using Next.js, Socket.IO, MongoDB, and Shadcn UI
- Follow modular, scalable, and clean architecture principles
- Use consistent code conventions and avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Work only on the steps assigned to you
- After finishing a step, mark it as completed in @history.md and stop
- Maintain proper folder structure and avoid creating unnecessary files
- Always propagate schema/type changes throughout all affected files to prevent runtime errors
- Use Yarn for dependency management
- Ensure real-time logic with Socket.IO is clean, modular, and doesn’t block the event loop
