- Record every completed step in a bullet format with timestamp
- Do not move on to the next step until explicitly told to
- If a file is changed in multiple places (like a schema), log that too
- Mark breaking changes and reason for them clearly
- Sync with developer instructions via step-by-step notes
- All tasks must be marked complete before continuing
